<H2>The Cutlers 400 Year Project at Magna</H2>
<P>To celebrate the 400th anniversary of the Company of Cutlers in Hallamshire the Sheffield College Work-Wise academy was asked to create an exhibition. This was showcased at Get Up To Speed at MAGNA, Rotherham on 20th March 2024.</P>
<P>The event was visited by around 5000 schoolchildren, businesses and leaders. The posters created for the event were then showcased in the Cutler's Hall itself.</P>
<P>A small mobile-based website was hosted <a href="https://jamesthomson.org.uk/cutlers400/">here on GitHub </a>with some of the details from the exhibition</P>
<P>The video created completely using AI is <a href="https://github.com/jameswathomson/cutlers400/blob/main/Cutlers400_s.mp4">here</a></P>
